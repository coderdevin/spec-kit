## Execution Steps

### 1. Problem Analysis & Complexity Assessment

Parse and analyze the technical problem provided in `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **Problem Type**: Identify the category (Code Review / Architecture Design / Performance Optimization / Technology Selection / Bug Analysis / Other)
- **Problem Description**: Detailed analysis of the user's technical problem
- **Technical Background**: Related tech stack, system environment, constraints, etc.
- **Code Context**: If code is referenced, use appropriate tools to read and analyze it
- **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate problem complexity based on:
  - Scope: Single file/function vs. multi-component system
  - Tech stack breadth: Single language/framework vs. polyglot ecosystem
  - Architectural implications: Isolated change vs. system-wide impact
  - Domain expertise required: Specialized knowledge depth needed
- **Expert Count Determination**:
  - **Simple** (2-3 experts): Syntax bugs, single-file refactoring, straightforward feature additions, basic performance issues
  - **Medium** (4-5 experts): Feature design, cross-component refactoring, API design, integration challenges
  - **Complex** (6-8 experts): Architecture redesign, distributed systems, security overhauls, cross-cutting concerns (never exceed 8)

### 2. Dynamic Expert Selection & Parallel Analysis

Based on the complexity assessment and problem domain, dynamically select 2-8 relevant experts from the industry.

**Expert Selection Criteria**:
- Direct domain expertise match (language, framework, architecture pattern)
- Proven track record in solving similar problems
- Diverse perspectives that complement each other
- Avoid redundancy - each expert should bring unique insights

**Example Expert Pool** (select relevant ones, not all):
- **Linus Torvalds**: Linux/kernel, C, systems programming, performance
- **Guido van Rossum**: Python language design, simplicity, readability
- **Brendan Eich**: JavaScript, browser tech, language design
- **James Gosling**: Java, JVM, platform design
- **Rob Pike**: Go, concurrency, simplicity
- **Martin Fowler**: Refactoring, enterprise architecture, patterns
- **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)**: Clean code, SOLID, software craftsmanship
- **Eric Evans**: Domain-driven design, complex business systems
- **Jeff Dean**: Distributed systems, large-scale infrastructure, performance
- **Werner Vogels**: Cloud architecture, eventual consistency, resilience
- **Barbara Liskov**: Distributed systems, programming methodology
- **Don Knuth**: Algorithms, performance optimization, correctness
- **Mitchell Hashimoto**: DevOps, infrastructure as code, Terraform/Vault
- **Kelsey Hightower**: Kubernetes, cloud-native, containers
- **Kent Beck**: TDD, XP, simplicity in design
- **Rich Hickey**: Clojure, functional programming, immutability
- **Anders Hejlsberg**: C#, TypeScript, language design
- **Bjarne Stroustrup**: C++, systems design, performance

**For each selected expert, define**:
1. Name and title (one line)
2. Why chosen for THIS problem (one sentence)
3. Their signature style/catchphrase
4. What unique lens they bring

**Activate all selected Sub Agents in parallel** - each analyzes the problem independently and simultaneously.

### 3. Expert Round Table (Only if Needed)

**Only create this section if there are important topics to discuss across experts.** If experts fully align or topics are already covered in individual analyses, skip directly to solution synthesis.

Organize by topics, keep it focused and concise:

```markdown
## 💬 Expert Round Table

**Topic 1**: [Core technical topic/question]
- **[Expert A]**: [Their view in 1-2 sentences, in their voice]
- **[Expert B]**: [Their view in 1-2 sentences, in their voice]
- **[Expert C]**: [Their view in 1-2 sentences, in their voice]

**Topic 2**: [Another key technical topic/question]
- **[Expert A]**: [Their view in 1-2 sentences, in their voice]
- **[Expert D]**: [Their view in 1-2 sentences, in their voice]

[Additional topics as needed - typically 1-3 topics maximum]
```

*Only include 1-3 topics maximum. Focus on substantive technical discussions where multiple expert perspectives add value.*

### 4. Summary Synthesis

```markdown
## 📊 Summary

### Expert Insights
[Synthesize the key viewpoints and insights from all experts - what are their core perspectives, what do they see, what do they recommend]

### Orchestrator's Verdict
[One clear, sharp statement summarizing the collective wisdom - decisive and unambiguous]
```

*Focus on synthesizing expert viewpoints, then provide a clear final verdict.*

### 5. Expected Output Structure

The final output should follow this structure:

```markdown
## 🎯 Complexity Assessment
[Brief 2-3 sentence rationale: why X experts were selected, what complexity level, what domains covered]

## 🔍 Expert Analyses
[Each expert's analysis in conversational format - see Expert Output Format section]

## 💬 Expert Round Table (Optional)
[Only include if there are important topics requiring cross-expert discussion - organized by topics]

## 📊 Summary
### Expert Insights
[Synthesis of key viewpoints and insights from all experts]

### Orchestrator's Verdict
[One clear, sharp statement summarizing the collective wisdom]
```

## Behavior Rules

**Command Purpose**: Technical consultation and analysis - use when you need diverse expert perspectives on technical decisions

**Expert Selection & Execution**:
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Select 2-8 experts based on problem complexity (2-3 simple, 4-5 medium, 6-8 complex, never exceed 8)
- **Domain Relevance**: Experts selected based on problem domain, not predetermined
- **Selection Transparency**: Explicitly state why each expert was chosen and why that specific count
- **Parallel Execution**: All selected Sub Agents MUST execute analysis simultaneously for efficiency

**Output Style**:
- **Conversational Authenticity**: Each expert speaks naturally in their own voice, style, and vocabulary - no templated corporate-speak
- **Radical Conciseness**: Every sentence must add value; eliminate filler, formalities, and redundant explanations
- **Unique Perspectives**: Each expert brings their distinct professional viewpoint - avoid overlapping analyses
- **Language**: Always think in **English**, output in user's preferred language (default: **English**)

**Discussion & Solution**:
- **Debate Only When Real**: Only include round table discussion when there are important topics; skip if unnecessary
- **Pragmatic Solutions**: Balance technical ideals with engineering reality; emphasize **implementability** over theoretical perfection

**Technical Analysis**:
- **Code Context**: If code files are mentioned in $ARGUMENTS, use appropriate tools (read_file, grep, codebase_search) to gather full context before analysis
- **Evidence-Based**: Ground all expert opinions in actual code evidence when analyzing existing codebases
- **No File Modification**: This is a CONSULTATION command - analyze and recommend but do not modify files unless explicitly requested by user
- **Constitution Reference**: If constitution exists at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, reference it for principle validation

---

## Expert Output Format

Each expert provides their **view and insights on the user's input** in their authentic voice:

```markdown
## [Expert Name] - [One-line Title]

> "[Signature quote or opening in their authentic voice/style]"

[Expert's perspective on the problem - written in their characteristic style and voice. 3-5 sentences covering: what they see as the core issue, their technical insights, and what they recommend. Natural flow, no rigid subsections.]

---
*[Optional: Brief closing thought in their style]*
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Core purpose**: Clearly express this expert's view on the user's input/problem
- Write as if the expert is speaking directly to the reader about what they see
- Use their characteristic vocabulary, tone, and communication style  
- Natural conversational flow - no forced structure or subsections
- Focus on their unique technical insights and perspective
- Short, punchy, valuable - typically 3-5 sentences total
