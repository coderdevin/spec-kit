**Review Scope**: {Description of what was reviewed}

---

{Include all 6 expert reviews}

---

{Include expert round table discussion}

---

{Include comprehensive review report}

---

## Review Completion
**Generated by**: Spec Kit Frontend Code Review System
**Report File**: {filename}
```

**Implementation**:
1. Use the `write` tool to create the markdown file at `.specify/reviews/code-review-{name}-{timestamp}.md`
2. Include all expert reviews, discussions, and comprehensive report
3. Confirm to user that report has been saved with full file path

### 6. Validation & Output

- **🟠 High (P1)**: Significant performance issues, major accessibility violations (WCAG AA failures), TypeScript `any` abuse, missing critical tests, insecure data handling → Fix within 1-2 days
- **🟡 Medium (P2)**: Code quality issues (clean code violations), moderate performance concerns, missing optimizations, incomplete test coverage, CSS architecture issues → Fix within 1 week
- **🟢 Low (P3)**: Style improvements, minor optimizations, nice-to-have enhancements, CSS refinements, documentation improvements → Plan for future

---

## Behavior Rules

- **Parallel Execution**: All 6 Sub Agents MUST execute reviews simultaneously for efficiency
- **Language**: Always think in **English**, output in **English**
- **Task List Format**: All issues MUST be formatted as markdown task lists using `- [ ]` checkbox syntax for easy tracking
- **Report Persistence**: MUST save the complete review report to `.specify/reviews/code-review-{name}-{timestamp}.md` using the `write` tool
- **Code Context**: Use appropriate tools (read_file, grep, codebase_search) to gather full context before review
- **No Code Modification**: This is a REVIEW command - analyze and recommend but do not modify source code files unless explicitly requested by user
- **Evidence-Based**: Ground all expert opinions in actual code evidence
- **Problematic Code Requirement**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Every issue identified MUST include the "Problematic Code" section with actual code snippets. This is essential evidence for review quality. Never skip this section - if there's no problematic code to show, the issue may not be valid.
- **Code Evidence Quality**: Each "Problematic Code" snippet must include sufficient context (minimum 3-5 lines) to understand the issue. Include surrounding code, imports, or dependencies if needed for clarity.
- **Unique Perspectives**: Each expert maintains their distinct professional viewpoint and review style
- **Priority-Driven**: Each expert must clearly indicate issue priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Final recommendations emphasize **implementability** and balance design purity with engineering pragmatism
- **Best Practices**: Follow official React documentation and TypeScript handbook
- **Modern Patterns**: Prefer Hooks and functional components over class components
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Compliance is expected
- **File Confirmation**: Always confirm to user the full path where the review report has been saved
- **Constitution Reference**: If `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists, reference it for principle validation
