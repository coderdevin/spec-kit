### 3. Organize Expert Technical Discussion

After collecting all expert reviews, synthesize key themes and facilitate discussion:

```markdown
## 💬 Expert Round Table Discussion

### 📋 [Topic 1]

**Key Perspectives**:
- 🎯 [Expert 1]: [One-line key insight]
- ⚡ [Expert 2]: [One-line key insight]
- 🔒 [Expert 3]: [One-line key insight]

*[Add 2-4 discussion topics focusing on issues where expert perspectives intersect or conflict]*
```

### 4. Save Review Report to File

After generating the comprehensive review report, save it to a markdown file:

**File Naming Convention**: `code-review-python-{module-name}-{timestamp}.md`
- Example: `code-review-python-user_service-2025-10-29-143022.md`
- Store in `.specify/reviews/` directory (create if not exists)

**File Content Structure**:
```markdown
# Python Code Review Report
**Review Date**: {Current Date and Time}
**Reviewed Code**: {File paths and module names}
**Review Scope**: {Description of what was reviewed}

---

---

{Include all 8 expert reviews - Issues Identified only}

---

{Include expert round table discussion if needed}
```

**Implementation**:
1. Use the `write` tool to create the markdown file at `.specify/reviews/code-review-python-{name}-{timestamp}.md`
2. Include all expert reviews and round table discussion (if needed)
3. Confirm to user that report has been saved with full file path

- Synthesized round table discussion (only if there are cross-cutting issues requiring multi-expert analysis)
- Overall assessment with quality scores
- Confirmation that report has been saved to file

**🚨 CRITICAL - Before Saving Report**:
- Verify each code example is 5-15 lines max
- Remove any complete implementations or lengthy examples
- Use `# ...` to indicate omitted sections
- Focus on problematic code + key fix only
- This prevents file save failures due to oversized reports

### 6. Completion Report

- Total issues found by priority (🔴 X Critical | 🟠 X High | 🟡 X Medium | 🟢 X Low)
- Report file location: `.specify/reviews/code-review-python-{name}-{timestamp}.md`
- Top 3 most critical issues to address first

---

## Priority System

- **🔴 Critical (P0)**: Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, command injection, deserialization, XSS, authentication bypass, exposed secrets), data corruption risks, broken functionality, resource leaks → Fix immediately
- **🟠 High (P1)**: Significant performance issues (N+1 queries, missing indexes), broken transactions, missing critical tests, insecure data handling, authentication/authorization issues → Fix within 1-2 days
- **🟡 Medium (P2)**: Code quality issues (SOLID violations, PEP 8 violations), moderate performance concerns, incomplete test coverage, missing error handling, suboptimal framework usage → Fix within 1 week
- **🟢 Low (P3)**: Style improvements, minor optimizations, docstring improvements, refactoring suggestions, dependency updates (non-security) → Plan for future

---

## Issues Identified Output Example

**CRITICAL: Keep code examples CONCISE to prevent oversized reports**
- Show ONLY the problematic lines (5-15 lines max)
- Show ONLY the key fix (5-15 lines max)
- Use `# ... (rest of code)` to indicate omitted sections
- Focus on the specific issue, not complete implementations

Here's an example of the correct issue format:

````markdown
## ⚠️ Exception Handling & Resource Management Expert

**Lead Reviewer**: Exception Handling & Resource Management Expert
**Review Philosophy**: "Expected failures are data, not exceptions; proper exception handling and resource management ensure application stability"

### 🔍 Issues Identified

- [ ] **[Using Exceptions for Expected Business Failures]**: Exception raised for expected business validation failure instead of returning Result/Either
  - **Code Location**: `account_service.py:45-52`
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Problematic Code**:
```python
# ❌ ISSUE: Using exceptions for expected business failures
def withdraw(self, account_id: int, amount: Decimal) -> None:
    account = self.account_repo.find_by_id(account_id)
    if account.balance < amount:
        # Expected business failure - should NOT use exception!
        raise InsufficientBalanceError("Insufficient balance")
    account.balance -= amount
    self.account_repo.save(account)
```

  - **Better Approach**:
```python
# ✅ FIX: Return Result type for expected failures
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Union

@dataclass
class Success:
    value: Account

@dataclass
class Failure:
    error: str

Result = Union[Success, Failure]

def withdraw(self, account_id: int, amount: Decimal) -> Result:
    account = self.account_repo.find_by_id(account_id)
    if account.balance < amount:
        return Failure("Insufficient balance")  # Data, not exception
    account.balance -= amount
    # ... (rest of logic)
    return Success(account)
```

---

- [ ] **[Missing Resource Cleanup]**: Database connection not properly closed in error scenarios
  - **Code Location**: `database.py:78-85`
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Problematic Code**:
```python
# ❌ ISSUE: Connection leak on exception
def execute_query(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
    conn = self.get_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    conn.close()  # Won't execute if exception occurs!
    return results
```

  - **Better Approach**:
```python
# ✅ FIX: Use context manager for guaranteed cleanup
def execute_query(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
    with self.get_connection() as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(query)
            return cursor.fetchall()
    # Connection automatically closed even on exception
```

## Behavior Rules

- **Language**: Always think in **English**, output in user-specified language (default: English)
- **Parallel Execution**: All 8 Sub Agents execute reviews simultaneously for efficiency
- **Task List Format**: All issues formatted as markdown task lists using `- [ ]` checkbox syntax
- **Report Persistence**: Save complete report to `.specify/reviews/code-review-python-{name}-{timestamp}.md` using `write` tool
- **Code Context**: Use tools (read_file, grep, codebase_search) to gather full context before review
- **No Code Modification**: Analyze and recommend only - do not modify source files unless explicitly requested
- **Evidence-Based**: Ground all opinions in actual code evidence
- **No Meta Information in Reports**: Include ONLY: Overall Assessment, Expert Reviews (Issues Identified), and Round Table Discussion (if needed)
- **Security First**: Security vulnerabilities always take highest priority
- **Best Practices**: Follow PEP 8, The Zen of Python, Python documentation, and framework-specific best practices
- **Constitution Reference**: Reference `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if exists
- **🚨 CONCISE CODE EXAMPLES**: Each code example must be 5-15 lines max. Show ONLY problematic code + key fix. Use `# ... (rest of code)` for omitted sections. This prevents oversized report files and save failures
