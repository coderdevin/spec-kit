- üéØ [Expert 1]: [One-line key insight]
- ‚ö° [Expert 2]: [One-line key insight]
- üîí [Expert 3]: [One-line key insight]

*[Add 2-4 discussion topics focusing on issues where expert perspectives intersect or conflict]*
```

### 4. Save Review Report to File

After generating the comprehensive review report, save it to a markdown file:

**File Naming Convention**: `code-review-vue-{component-name}-{timestamp}.md`
- Example: `code-review-vue-UserDashboard-2025-10-30-143022.md`
- Store in `.specify/reviews/` directory (create if not exists)

**File Content Structure**:
```markdown
# Vue 2.7 Frontend Code Review Report
**Review Date**: {Current Date and Time}
**Reviewed Code**: {File paths and component names}
**Review Scope**: {Description of what was reviewed}
**Vue Version**: 2.7.x

- Synthesized round table discussion (only if there are cross-cutting issues requiring multi-expert analysis)
- Overall assessment with quality scores
- Confirmation that report has been saved to file

### 6. Completion Report

Output a brief final summary to the user (console/chat only, NOT in the saved report file):
- Total issues found by priority (üî¥ X Critical | üü† X High | üü° X Medium | üü¢ X Low)
- Report file location: `.specify/reviews/code-review-vue-{name}-{timestamp}.md`
- Top 3 most critical issues to address first

---

## Priority System

- **üü¢ Low (P3)**: Style improvements, minor optimizations, nice-to-have enhancements, CSS refinements, documentation improvements ‚Üí Plan for future

---

## Behavior Rules

- **Parallel Execution**: All 6 Sub Agents MUST execute reviews simultaneously for efficiency
- **Language**: Always think in **English**, output in user-specified language (default: English for international teams, ‰∏≠Êñá if user requests)
- **Task List Format**: All issues MUST be formatted as markdown task lists using `- [ ]` checkbox syntax for easy tracking
- **Report Persistence**: MUST save the complete review report to `.specify/reviews/code-review-vue-{name}-{timestamp}.md` using the `write` tool
- **Code Context**: Use appropriate tools (read_file, grep, codebase_search) to gather full context before review
- **No Code Modification**: This is a REVIEW command - analyze and recommend but do not modify source code files unless explicitly requested by user
- **Evidence-Based**: Ground all expert opinions in actual code evidence
- **No Meta Information in Reports**: Do NOT include meta descriptions like "Key Improvements", "Benefits", "Implementation Details", "Quality Gates", or explanatory sections about the review process itself. Reports should contain ONLY: Overall Assessment, Expert Reviews (Issues Identified), and Round Table Discussion (if needed)
- **Unique Perspectives**: Each expert maintains their distinct professional viewpoint and review style
- **Best Practices**: Follow official Vue 2.7 documentation and TypeScript handbook
- **Vue 2.7 Features**: Recognize and evaluate Vue 2.7's backported Composition API features
- **Constitution Reference**: If `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists, reference it for principle validation
