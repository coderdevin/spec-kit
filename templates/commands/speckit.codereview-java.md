- **Code Context**: Use tools (read_file, grep, codebase_search) to gather full context
- **Review Scope**: Identify classes, interfaces, methods, Spring components, and tests
- **Objectives**: Understand business logic, technical requirements, and specific concerns

### 2. Parallel Expert Review

#### Sub Agent 4: Exception Handling & Resource Management Expert

**Specialty**: Exception handling strategies, try-with-resources, error management, logging, resource cleanup, expected vs unexpected failures

**Review Style**: Focus on system fault tolerance, proper resource management, and distinguishing business failures from system exceptions

**Review Philosophy**: "Expected failures are data, not exceptions; proper exception handling and resource management ensure application stability"

**Core Principle**: **"Expected failures are data, not exceptions"**

**Guidelines:**
- **Exceptions** should be strictly reserved for "unexpected" system-level failures (e.g., database connection loss, network interruption, programming errors)
- **Business logic failures** (e.g., invalid user input, insufficient permissions, business rule violations) should be handled as explicit return data (Result/Either types, Optional, domain-specific result objects)

**Focus Areas**:
- **Expected vs Unexpected Failures**: Use Result/Either types for business failures (validation, authorization, not found); use exceptions for system failures (database connection, network, programming errors)
- **Exception Handling**: Checked vs unchecked usage, custom exception hierarchy, exception wrapping, avoid catching Exception/Throwable, specific exceptions only
- **Resource Management**: Try-with-resources for AutoCloseable, JDBC connections cleanup, InputStream/OutputStream closure, connection pool management
- **Exception Propagation**: Translation at layer boundaries, convert technical to domain exceptions, preserve context and stack traces
- **Logging & Security**: Appropriate log levels, exception logging with stack traces, avoid sensitive data in logs, generic user messages vs detailed admin logs

**Review Output Format**: Follow the format shown in "Issues Identified Output Example" section below

#### Sub Agent 5: Spring Framework & MyBatis Expert

### 3. Organize Expert Technical Discussion

After collecting all expert reviews, synthesize key themes and facilitate discussion:

```markdown
## 💬 Expert Round Table Discussion

### 📋 [Topic 1]

**Key Perspectives**:
- 🎯 [Expert 1]: [One-line key insight]
- ⚡ [Expert 2]: [One-line key insight]
- 🔒 [Expert 3]: [One-line key insight]

*[Add 2-4 discussion topics focusing on issues where expert perspectives intersect or conflict]*
```

### 4. Save Review Report to File

After generating the comprehensive review report, save it to a markdown file:

**File Naming Convention**: `code-review-java-{class-name}-{timestamp}.md`
- Example: `code-review-java-UserService-2025-10-29-143022.md`
- Store in `.specify/reviews/` directory (create if not exists)

**File Content Structure**:
```markdown
# Java Code Review Report
**Review Date**: {Current Date and Time}
**Reviewed Code**: {File paths and class names}
**Review Scope**: {Description of what was reviewed}

---

- Overall assessment with quality scores
- Confirmation that report has been saved to file

### 6. Completion Report

Output a brief final summary to the user (console/chat only, NOT in the saved report file):
- Total issues found by priority (🔴 X Critical | 🟠 X High | 🟡 X Medium | 🟢 X Low)
- Report file location: `.specify/reviews/code-review-java-{name}-{timestamp}.md`
- Top 3 most critical issues to address first

---

## Priority System

- **🔴 Critical (P0)**: Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, deserialization, XSS, authentication bypass, exposed secrets), data corruption risks, broken functionality, resource leaks → Fix immediately
- **🟠 High (P1)**: Significant performance issues (N+1 queries, missing indexes), broken transactions, missing critical tests, insecure data handling, Spring Security misconfigurations → Fix within 1-2 days
- **🟡 Medium (P2)**: Code quality issues (SOLID violations, clean code violations), moderate performance concerns, incomplete test coverage, missing error handling, suboptimal Spring usage → Fix within 1 week
- **🟢 Low (P3)**: Style improvements, minor optimizations, Javadoc improvements, refactoring suggestions, dependency updates (non-security) → Plan for future

## Issues Identified Output Example

**🚨 CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE**: All code examples must be CONCISE (5-15 lines max). Show ONLY problematic code + key fix. Use `// ... (rest of code)` for omitted sections. This prevents oversized report files and save failures.

Here's an example of the correct issue format:

````markdown
## ⚠️ Exception Handling & Resource Management Expert

**Lead Reviewer**: Exception Handling & Resource Management Expert
**Review Philosophy**: "Expected failures are data, not exceptions; proper exception handling and resource management ensure application stability"

### 🔍 Issues Identified

- [ ] **[Using Exceptions for Expected Business Failures]**: Exception thrown for expected business validation failure instead of returning Result/Either
  - **Code Location**: `AccountService.java:92-98`
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Problematic Code with Inline Improvement Guidance**:

```java
// ❌ ISSUE: Using exceptions for expected business failures
public void withdraw(Long accountId, BigDecimal amount) throws InsufficientBalanceException {
    Account account = accountRepository.findById(accountId).orElseThrow(...);
    if (account.getBalance().compareTo(amount) < 0) {
        throw new InsufficientBalanceException("Insufficient balance"); // Expected failure!
    }
    // ... (rest of code)
}

// ✅ BETTER APPROACH: Return Result type for expected failures
public Result<Account, WithdrawalError> withdraw(Long accountId, BigDecimal amount) {
    Optional<Account> accountOpt = accountRepository.findById(accountId);
    if (accountOpt.isEmpty()) {
        return Result.failure(WithdrawalError.ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND); // Data, not exception
    }
    if (account.getBalance().compareTo(amount) < 0) {
        return Result.failure(WithdrawalError.INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE); // Data, not exception
    }
    // ... (rest of code)
    return Result.success(saved);
}
```

- **Parallel Execution**: All 8 Sub Agents execute reviews simultaneously for efficiency
- **Task List Format**: All issues formatted as markdown task lists using `- [ ]` checkbox syntax
- **Report Persistence**: Save complete report to `.specify/reviews/code-review-java-{name}-{timestamp}.md` using `write` tool
- **Code Context**: Use tools (read_file, grep, codebase_search) to gather full context before review
- **No Code Modification**: Analyze and recommend only - do not modify source files unless explicitly requested

- **Security First**: Security vulnerabilities always take highest priority
- **Best Practices**: Follow Effective Java, Spring Framework docs, and Java EE best practices
- **Constitution Reference**: Reference `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if exists
- **🚨 CONCISE CODE EXAMPLES**: All code examples MUST be 5-15 lines max. Show ONLY problematic code + key fix. Use `// ... (rest of code)` for omitted sections. This prevents report file save failures.
