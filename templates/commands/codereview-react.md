- Example: `code-review-UserDashboard-2025-10-28-143022.md`
- Store in `.specify/reviews/` directory (create if not exists)

**File Content Structure**:
```markdown
# Frontend Code Review Report
**Review Date**: {Current Date and Time}
**Reviewed Code**: {File paths and component names}
**Review Scope**: {Description of what was reviewed}

---

{Include all 6 expert reviews}

---

{Include expert round table discussion}

---

{Include comprehensive review report}

---

## Review Completion
**Generated by**: Spec Kit Frontend Code Review System
**Report File**: {filename}
```

**Implementation**:
1. Use the `write` tool to create the markdown file at `.specify/reviews/code-review-{name}-{timestamp}.md`
2. Include all expert reviews, discussions, and comprehensive report

- **Unique Perspectives**: Each expert maintains their distinct professional viewpoint and review style
- **Unified Format**: Consistent output structure but with distinct analytical angles and rich technical details
- **Debate & Synthesis**: Discussion session should demonstrate collision and fusion of different technical viewpoints
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Final recommendations based on **collective technical wisdom** emphasizing **implementability**
- **Pragmatic Principle**: Balance design purity with engineering reality
- **Priority-Driven**: Each expert must clearly indicate issue priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Code Context**: Use appropriate tools (read_file, grep, codebase_search) to gather full context before review
- **No Code Modification**: This is a REVIEW command - analyze and recommend but do not modify source code files unless explicitly requested by user
- **Evidence-Based**: Ground all expert opinions in actual code evidence when reviewing codebases
- **React Best Practices**: Follow official React documentation and community best practices

## Common Frontend Anti-Patterns to Detect

### React Component Anti-Patterns
```typescript
// ❌ Massive component with multiple responsibilities
function UserDashboard() {
  // 500+ lines handling users, orders, analytics, settings...
}

// ✅ Split into focused components
function UserDashboard() {
  return (
    <>
      <UserProfile />
      <OrderHistory />
      <AnalyticsSummary />
      <UserSettings />
    </>
  )
}

// ❌ Too many props (prop drilling)
function Button({ 
  onClick, disabled, loading, variant, size, color, 
  icon, iconPosition, fullWidth, rounded, shadow 
}) { }

// ✅ Use composition or config object
function Button({ 
  onClick, 
  config: ButtonConfig, 
  children 
}) { }
```

### React Hooks Anti-Patterns
```typescript
// ❌ Missing dependencies in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId)
}, []) // userId should be in deps

// ✅ Complete dependency array
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId)
}, [userId])

// ❌ Hooks in conditionals
if (condition) {
  const [state, setState] = useState() // Violates Rules of Hooks
}

// ✅ Hooks at top level
const [state, setState] = useState()
if (condition) {
  // Use state here
}
```

### TypeScript Anti-Patterns
```typescript
// ❌ Using `any` everywhere
function processData(data: any): any {
  return data.map((item: any) => item.value)
}

// ✅ Proper type definitions
interface DataItem {
  id: string
  value: number
}

function processData(data: DataItem[]): number[] {
  return data.map(item => item.value)
}

// ❌ Type assertions without validation
const user = data as User // Unsafe

// ✅ Type guards
function isUser(data: unknown): data is User {
  return (
    typeof data === 'object' &&
    data !== null &&
    'id' in data &&
    'name' in data
  )
}

if (isUser(data)) {
  const user = data // Safe
}
```

### State Management Anti-Patterns
```typescript
// ❌ Prop drilling through many layers
<Parent userId={userId}>
  <Child userId={userId}>
    <GrandChild userId={userId}>
      <GreatGrandChild userId={userId} />
    </GrandChild>
  </Child>
</Parent>

// ✅ Context for shared state
const UserContext = createContext<User | null>(null)

function Parent() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Child />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  )
}

// ❌ State in wrong location
function Button() {
  const [userProfile, setUserProfile] = useState() // Too local
}

// ✅ State at appropriate level
function App() {
  const [userProfile, setUserProfile] = useState()
  return <Button />
}
```

### Performance Anti-Patterns
```typescript
// ❌ Creating objects/functions in render
function List({ items }) {
  return items.map(item => (
    <Item 
      key={item.id}
      onClick={() => handleClick(item.id)} // New function every render
      style={{ padding: 10 }} // New object every render
    />
  ))
}

// ✅ Memoize callbacks and use stable references
const ITEM_STYLE = { padding: 10 }

function List({ items }) {
  const handleClick = useCallback((id: string) => {
    // Handle click
  }, [])
  
  return items.map(item => (
    <Item 
      key={item.id}
      onClick={() => handleClick(item.id)}
      style={ITEM_STYLE}
    />
  ))
}

// ❌ Unnecessary re-renders
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
      <ExpensiveChild /> {/* Re-renders on every count change */}
    </>
  )
}

// ✅ Memoize expensive children
const MemoizedExpensiveChild = React.memo(ExpensiveChild)

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
      <MemoizedExpensiveChild />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Accessibility Anti-Patterns
```typescript
// ❌ Non-semantic HTML and missing accessibility
<div onClick={handleClick}>
  Click me
</div>

<div>
  <span>Label</span>
  <input />
</div>

// ✅ Semantic HTML with proper accessibility
<button onClick={handleClick} aria-label="Submit form">
  Click me
</button>

<label htmlFor="username">
  Username
  <input id="username" type="text" aria-required="true" />
</label>

// ❌ No keyboard support
<div onClick={handleClick}>Menu</div>

// ✅ Full keyboard support
<button 
  onClick={handleClick}
  onKeyDown={(e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
      handleClick()
    }
  }}
  tabIndex={0}
  role="button"
  aria-label="Open menu"
>
  Menu
</button>
```
